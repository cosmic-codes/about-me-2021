    <h1>Hello there, and welcome!</h1>

    <p>
      This is a basic page I've organized to showcase my projects a bit more. By context, I assume you likely want to see some of my code, and/or some highlights of them in action.
      I plan to cover:
      -Bob
      -This page
      -Soundboard
      -Information on private projects (design team work kept private to protect from tampering/piracy)
    </p>
    Here's a cool image of Bob, the companion from my resume. He's happy to meet you!

    <p>
      This is one of many PNGs used for his actual code. I am working with <a href="https://celestia-knight.wixsite.com/portfolio" target="_blank">CelestiaKnight</a> to obtain all the visuals, menu boxes, scroll bars, etc. so that Bob looks his best when I officially release him!
    </p>
    Assuming you've read my resume/LinkedIn, you've likely seen the basic concept of what I hope to accomplish with him. But I'll restate it with some technical information, for completion's sake.
    <h3>SSP Release Progress</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Technical: Graphics and menus must be manually tested to define clickable areas. General debug/cleanup for polished release; fix minor notes and details. (93% complete)</li>
      <li>Graphics: Functionally complete. (100% complete)</li>
      <li>Text Dictionaries: Dialogue must be formatted with the appropriate cues for images, pauses, links, and other details. (10% complete)</li>
      <li>Future Releases: Additional dialogue, images, functionality. Improve documentation for young/inexperienced developers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'd like to make a note for those who've seen the project dates on my resume and LinkedIn--though this project was time-consuming, it wasn't difficult enough to consume
      three years. Here is a general development timeline of when things happened:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2018: Project concept, unpublished beta version. 75% of the working code.</li>
      <li>2019: Researched and refined code from a Japanese example. 25% of the working code.</li>
      <li>February 2020: Began commission work with CelestiaKnight to obtain images for the project's front end.</li>
      <li>May 2020 to May 2021: Project hiatus amid family/financial struggles, design team research, and major death in my family.</li>
      <li>June 2021: Gathered the commission work to assemble the front end, begin processing code/dictionaries for official release.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I wanted to ensure that I was transparent about the time frames. I take my projects seriously, and did not want to give the impression that it took three years
    in total to reach this level of progress.
    </p>
    <h3>Web/Android Release</h3>
    <p>
      Downloading executables from 2002 on a site in a different language is mildly intimidating to those with common computing sense--especially on a work computer. Therefore, I plan to release Bob as an app once I have finished his first SSP release. Details to follow soon!

    Thank you for scrolling this far! I hope you've enjoyed what you've seen here, on either a technical or humorous basis.
